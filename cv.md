#### Briefly About Myself:
I started my career in 2007. Worked as a PCB assembly operator. From 2009 to 2014 I worked as a leading electrical engineer in a company that develops measuring equipment and automation. Since 2014 until 2021 I worked for an electronic equipment repair company. Now I want to change the direction of development from hard to software. Since I like developing interfaces more, I chose front-end.
